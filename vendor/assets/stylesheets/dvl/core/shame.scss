// Rules
// 1. If itâ€™s a hack, it goes in shame.css.
// 2. Document all hacks fully:
//    - What part of the codebase does it relate to?
//    - Why was this needed?
//    - How does this fix it?
//    - How might you fix it properly, given more time?
// 3. Do not blame the developer; if they explained why
//    they had to do it, then their reasons are probably
//    (hopefully) valid.
// 4. Try and clean shame.css up when you have some down time.
//    - Even better, create an issue where you can allocate
//      some time for it.
//
// App-specific hacks are located in app/stylesheets/shame.scss within their respective repo
